# JAPAN-EARTHQUAKE
Comparison of Two Different Data Set and Two Different Year. 

Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone country, because it sits atop four intersecting plates - the Pacific Plate, the Philippine Sea Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the North American Plate â€“ that are continually grinding against one another, Japan is among the nations most vulnerable to earthquakes. Japan has a long history of frequent earthquakes due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. 

This abstract highlights the significance of researching Japan's seismic history in order to better understand the country's response to seismic hazards and to provide important insights for other areas of the world that are vulnerable to comparable geological hazards.
